Our proposed method is a modification of the existing learn-morph-infer pipeline \parencite{LearnMorphInfer} and therefore closely related to it.
\todo{extend similar work}\\
The author has studied about autoencoders mainly from \parencite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.\\
Losses have been plotted using TensorBoard and the seaborn library. All tumor visualizations have been created with the Mayavi framework \todo{maybe cite mayavi}.
