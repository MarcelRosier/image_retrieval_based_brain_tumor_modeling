\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

- we have shown that its possible to encode data for time and space complexity improvement while preserving similarity relationships between input and synthetic tumors up to a certain degree \newline
- errors that might not be predictable make real world application \newline
- we believe that this work has applications and results motivate further research
